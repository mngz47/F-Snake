The classic Snake game is a timeless and iconic arcade experience that has captivated players for decades. In this simple yet addictive game, players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food items scattered across the screen. The objective is to navigate the snake to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake’s own tail.

<b>Version 1</b> built in seven days has a hard and easy mode. The hard more lags when the snake body gets big. And there's a bug causing the snake to grow indefinately.

<b>Version 2</b> is more stable as the body of the snake is limited but to improve the experience the obstacle has varying speeds.
